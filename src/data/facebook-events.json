    "description": "A Day of Smiles, Strength & Shared Dreams at Janeshwar Mishra Park \n\nToday was one of those days that quietly reminds us why we do what we do.\n\nThe mentors of Perhit Siksha Foundation, Lucknow came together with our mentees (beneficiaries) and their families for a warm, joyful, and deeply meaningful get-together at the serene Janeshwar Mishra Park.\n\nAround 40 beneficiaries, along with their parents, joined us—turning the gathering into a beautiful blend of young aspirations, parental hopes, and collective encouragement. What unfolded was not just an event, but a living example of mentorship in action.\n\nThe session began with introductions, where each child spoke about themselves--some confidently, some shyly, but all with sincerity. This was followed by morale-boosting interactions that gently reminded our children of their immense potential.\n\nA special highlight was the inspiring address by our senior mentor, Smt. Seema Jain, whose words resonated deeply with the beneficiaries. Her motivating message on giving their best in studies, believing in themselves, and staying consistent struck a powerful chord with both children and parents alike.\n\nTo keep the atmosphere lively and engaging, the session featured the classic and much-loved game “Atlas”, enthusiastically facilitated by our mentor Sh. Abhishek Raj, where laughter, quick thinking, and teamwork filled the air.\n\nWe also had an interactive discussion on Republic Day, helping children connect with the values of our Constitution, patriotism, and their role as responsible citizens of tomorrow—just a day before the nation celebrates this proud occasion.\n\nThe session concluded with light refreshments, informal conversations, and smiles all around—simple moments that build trust, bonding, and a sense of belonging. Parents shared their thoughts, children laughed freely, and mentors felt quietly fulfilled.\n\nFrom candid smiles to thoughtful expressions, we captured these precious moments through our cameras—memories that will stay with us long after the day ends.\n\nA heartfelt thanks to our dedicated mentors who made this gathering so enriching and memorable:\n\nSmt. Seema Jain\n\nSh. Prashant Mishra\n\nSh. Bablu Gupta\n\nSh. Abhishek Raj\n\nSmt. Akanksha Srivastava\n\nSh. Nirankar Jaiswal\n\nAt Perhit Siksha Foundation, we believe education is not just about books—it’s about confidence, care, continuity, and community. Today reaffirmed our belief that when children are supported with empathy and guidance, they begin to dream bigger and walk stronger.",

Arora ji has been the very pillar of the Perhit Siksha Foundation since its inception- a mentor, an administrator, and a guiding light who has nurtured and shaped this mission selflessly from its earliest days, even before the Foundation formally came into existence. \n\nHis commitment to service extends far beyond us; during the difficult days of the COVID-19 pandemic, he stood at the forefront as an active member of the Lucknow Covid Response Team, rendering tireless service through relief initiatives and the Covid Kitchen for patients’ attendants.\n\nAs he endures this irreparable personal loss, the entire Perhit Siksha Foundation family stands firmly with him --united in prayer, solidarity, and shared grief.\n\nWe earnestly pray to the Almighty to grant strength, courage, and inner peace to Shri P. M. Arora ji and his family during this time of profound sorrow.",

Seema Jain Ma’am spent a meaningful day with Perhit Siksha Foundation children at Begum Hazrat Mahal Park and Smriti Upvan, filling the day with smiles, confidence and hope.\n\nAt Begum Hazrat Mahal Park, young children from primary classes opened up freely about their learning difficulties—from multiplication and spellings to understanding tough words. Their honesty and eagerness to improve were truly inspiring. Ma’am guided parents to help children at home through simple mental maths, regular dictations, a peaceful study environment and daily communication.\n\nLater at Smriti Upvan, students from Classes 7 to 11 impressed Ma’am with their dedication, discipline and dreams. She shared that she could clearly see hope and aspiration in every child’s eyes—a desire to become self-reliant through education.\n\nWe express our heartfelt gratitude to Seema Ma’am for her time, guidance and her compassionate connection with the children.\n\nHere are a few glimpses from this enriching day.",
